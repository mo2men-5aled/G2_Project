# G2_Project

## - first of all, I've imported the data CSV file "G2_anthropometry.csv"

## - then, the data first and latest 5 rows

## - then, I've viewed the data values shape and then i viewed the data structure to see the type of data stored on each col, and then applied some statistcs for the csv file like the mean, median, min and max values

## - then, I've converted the age col to contain only int values so if it has any other data with the type other than integers it will be converted to integers

## - after that the data contains an empty values, fill them by calculating a mean from the entire data

## - the age col was contaning wrong data "cm" instead of "M" which stands for males, I've removed the the wrong value and replace it with the "M" char

## - convert the height col to contain only numeric data

## - then started making charts

    - first create a pie chart for gender distribution
    - then created a scatter plot for the height and age
    - created a scatter plot of age and foot_length
    - created a scatter plot of height and foot_length
    - created a scatter plot of age and foot_length
    - created a histogram of female heights
    - created a histogram of male heights
    - created a histogram of male foot_length
    - created a histogram of female foot_length
